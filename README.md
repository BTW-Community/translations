# Better Than Wolves: CE Fan Translation Addon

This is a repository to allow the community to contribute fan translations. Each contribution is automatically packaged up as a new [release](https://github.com/BTW-Community/translations/releases/latest), so that language contributors no longer have to wait long times for their contributions to get included in the next release.

## FAQ

### Q: How do I install this addon?

The same way you install the BTW mod: you put it in your mods folder alongside the BTW jar.

### Q: Why not include the translations in the mod anymore?

There were issues with quality control for languages not spoken by the CE team, as well as liability issues, and it sometimes took months for translations to make it into a mod release. We realize it's annoying that your hard work is not available by default, but this truly is the best option for all parties involved.

### Q: How do I contribute my own translation?

The best way is for you to make what's called a PR (Pull Request) here on Github. Someone will then include it for you, which will instantly trigger a new release. Alternatively if you find Github too confusing, you can try to find someone on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/fhMK5kx) who will submit it for you.
